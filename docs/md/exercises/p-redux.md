## Angular 5 Training Course
## Exercise N-redux

- This exercise will use the **Redux** library to centralise management of application state in one place.
- This application state will be isolated into a **Redux store**.
- Components will use **Redux actions** and the **Redux getState** method to change state in the store.
- The basic Angular application **without Redux** has been built for you.

#### Setup

- Create a new project. *Avoid naming it Redux.*

		ng new state
		
- Open that folder and install the Redux library. 
- This will update package.json in the statefolder

		cd state
		npm install redux
		
- Open the Angular project

		ng serve --open
		
- We will now add Redux code to centralise state within the application.

#### Define state

- Create a new folder **src/app/redux**.
- Define state as a Typescript interface in **redux/redux.state.ts**
		
		export interface Trip{
			airport:string;
			parking:boolean;
		}

		
#### Define actions

- We need to define **actions** to set the airport, parking, hotel and hirecar.
- Here are examples of the four types of action object:

			{ type:"airport", data:"heathrow" }
			{ type:"parking", data:false }

- Create a new file **redux/redux.actions.ts**.
- We can define the action types as constants to avoid bugs caused by case-sensitive text.

		const AIRPORT : string = "airport" ;
		const PARKING : string = "parking" ;
		
- We will define **action creators**. These functions take two arguments: the action type and any associated data.

		setAirport( AIRPORT , "heathrow" );
		// returns { type:"airport", data:"heathrow" }

- Add the action creators.

		export let setAirport = ( airport:string ) => ({ type: AIRPORT,data: airport }) ;
		export let setParking = ( parking:boolean ) => ({ type: PARKING,data: parking }) ;

#### Reducer

- Two arguments are passed in to the **reducer** function: the current state and a specific action object.
- The reducer is a **pure function**. It does not directly change the Redux store. 
- Instead, it will make a **copy** of the current state. It will update that copy based on the action object passed to it.
- The reducer returns the updated object.
- The Redux store will update itself and broadcast its changed state to any listening **subscribers**.
- Create a reducer file **redux/redux.reducer.ts**.
- Make the reducer aware of the state interface you defined in **redux/redux.state.ts**

		import { Trip } from './redux.state';
		
- Import the action types.

		import { AIRPORT, PARKING } from './redux.actions';

- Define a simple reducer that does nothing but return the current state unchanged.
- We have defined the initial state as an empty object.

		export let reducer = (state:Trip={}, action) => {
	    console.log( state,action );
	    return state;
		}

#### Create the Redux store

- We will create the store using the Redux library **createStore** method. We pass it our **reducer** function.

		createStore( reducer );
		
- We can use **dependency injection** to make all the components in all app aware of the store. 
- Create **redux/redux.store.ts**
- Import the Redux library and your reducer function.

		import { createStore } from 'redux';
		import { reducer } from './redux.reducer';

- Write a function the creates the store.

		export function makeStore() {
	    return createStore( reducer );
		}
		
- Add code which allows Angular to pass around the store created by makeStore using dependency injection.

		import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';
		
		export const TripStore = new InjectionToken('Trip.store');

		export const storeProvider = [
		    { provide: TripStore, useFactory: makeStore }
		];

- This provider needs to be defined in the app.module.ts

			import { storeProvider } from './redux/redux.store';
	  
		  providers: [storeProvider],

#### Inject the store into the main component.

- Import the built-in Inject annotation.

		import { Inject } from '@angular/core';

- Import the Redux library.

		import * as Redux from 'redux'
		
- Import the store as a DI token

		import { TripStore } from '../redux/redux.store';
	
- Import the state defined as a Typescript interface

		import { Trip } from './redux/redux.state';
	
- Import the Action types (copy code from reducer)

		import { AIRPORT, PARKING } from './redux.actions';
		
- Create a constructor which passes in the DI token

		    constructor(@Inject(TripStore) private store:Redux.Store<Trip>) {}

- Your reducer function will start logging the current state and action objects to the browser console.

				undefined {type: "@@redux/INIT"}
				
- Add Observable code which logs when the store changes state.

			store.subscribe(() => console.log( "GETSTATE" ,store.getState());
			
- Currently we are not dispatching any actions, so we will not see this code running.

#### Inject the store into the airport component.

- Add import statements to **airport/airport.component.ts**
- Note the relative path names may differ from the main component.
		
		import * as Redux from 'redux'
		import { TripStore } from '../redux/redux.store';
		import { Trip } from '../redux/redux.state';
		import { setAirport, setParking } from '../redux/redux.actions';



- Pass the store into the constructor using DI.
- Remember to import the Inject annotation.

			import { ..Inject } from '@angular/core';

		    constructor(@Inject(TripStore) private store:Redux.Store<Trip>) {
        store.subscribe(() => console.log( store.getState());
    }

#### Listen for form changes and dispatch actions.

- Currently the code logs changes to the entire form.

		this.fg.valueChanges.subscribe( data => console.log( data ))

- We can choose to log changes to specific form fields.

		this.fg.controls.airport.valueChanges.subscribe( data => console.log( data ))
	
- Create a method that dispatches setAirport **actions**.

	    setAirport(s) {
	        this.store.dispatch(setAirport(s));
	    }
	    
- Call this function from the observable:

		this.fg.controls.airport.valueChanges.subscribe( data => this.setAirport( data ))
		
- The Redux state is logged to the console when we select a different airport. But it does not appear to change.
- We need to add custom logic to the reducer to handle this case.
- Add a switch statement to the reducer.
- Note that Object.assign is used. The reducer is a pure function which returns a **changed copy** of the current state.

		    switch (action.type) {
        case AIRPORT:
            return Object.assign( {} , state, { airport: action.data });
        default:
            return state;
    }
    
- Change airports in the form. It should log changes of state.

#### Parking

- Add another case to the reducer for the parking.

		        case PARKING:
            return Object.assign( {} , state, { parking: action.data });
            
- Create a method that dispatches parking actions.

		    setParking(b) {
        this.store.dispatch(setParking(b));
    }
    
- Listen for changes to the parking checkbox.

		this.fg.controls.parking.valueChanges.subscribe( data => this.setParking( data ))
            
#### Update the message in the main component

- Define an object and update this to reflect the store.

	    trip:object;
	
	    constructor(..) {
	        store.subscribe(() => this.updateMessage());
	        this.updateMessage()
	    }
	
	    updateMessage() {
	        this.trip = this.store.getState()
	    }
	    
- Update the main template

		{{ trip.airport }}
		{{ trip.parking ? "with" : "without" }}
		{{ trip.hotel }}
		{{ trip.hirecar ? "with" : "without" }}
