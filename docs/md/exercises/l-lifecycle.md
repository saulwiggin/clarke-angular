## Angular 5 Training Course
## Exercise L-LIFECYCLE Events/Hooks
   
- We will define hooks/methods that run at specific moments in the **life-cycle** of a component.
- Rebuild the existing project.

		npm install
		ng serve --open
		
- We will implement life-cycle hook interfaces defined in Angular.
		
		import {
			OnInit,
			OnDestroy,
			OnChanges,
			DoCheck,
			SimpleChanges
		} from '@angular/core';
		
		export class TincanComponent 
		implements OnInit,OnDestroy, OnChanges,DoCheck { .. }
		
- We can then define methods which use these names, prefixed with ng, such as **ngOnInit**.

#### Constructor

- The template contains an instance of the TinCan component.
- We pass in two inputs: **price** and **product**.

		<tincan [product]="product" [price]="price" 
		*ngIf="state"></tincan>
		
- If we attempt to log product and price in the constructor of **tincan.component.ts** it displays **undefined**.

		    constructor() {
	        console.log( "constructor" );
	        console.log( this.product, this.price );
		    }
		    
- Input bindings for a component are not yet defined/established in the constructor.


		    
- Remove the 2nd console.log statement.
- However, we can use **dependency injection (DI)** in the constructor to call a service.
- A **shop service** is defined with a **getName method**.
- We can inject an instance of this into the constructor.

			constructor( shop:ShopService ) { .. }
			
- We can set the name property using this method.

			this.name = shop.getName();

#### OnInit

- To see the Input bindings, console.log them in **ngOnInit**..

		    ngOnInit() {
	        console.log("ngOnInit", this.product, this.price );		
	        
- Both DI and Input bindings will be working at this point. 
- This method is a good choice to request data from a service.

#### OnDestroy

- In the main component template, we have defined an **ngIf** directive. 
- We have defined a boolean variable called state.
- If this is set to false, a component instance will be removed from the DOM and an **ngOnDestroy** method triggered.
- If it is set to true, a component instance will be recreated in the DOM and an **ngOnInit** method will be triggered.

		<tincan .. *ngIf="state"></tincan>

- The remove and create buttons already have click handlers set up.

		    <p (click)="remove()">Remove</p>
        <p (click)="create()">Create</p>

- Add logic to set this boolean variable.

		    remove() {
	        this.state = false;
		    }

		    create() {
	        this.state = true;
		    }
		    
- Add debugging to the ngOnDestroy method.

		    ngOnDestroy() {
	        console.log("ngOnDestroy" , this);
	        
- Review this in the Chrome web tools Elements tab. You can see the TinCan component being removed and added to the DOM.

#### Removing Observable subscribers in ngOnDestroy.

- Create an Observable by calling createSequence in the constructor.

			this.createSequence();
			
- Run this. It displays the number sequence on the page and in the console.
- Click remove to remove the component. Note that the Observable subscriber code continues to run in the console.
- Use ngOnDestroy to unsubscribe from the Observable.

		this.sequence.unsubscribe()
		
#### ngOnChanges

- Add this life-cycle hook which is invoked when there are changes to the **INPUTS** passed into a component.		

		    ngOnChanges( changes: SimpleChanges ) {
	        console.log( JSON.stringify( changes ));
		    }
		    
- Add an increasePrice method to the main component. This will change the **price input**.

			    increasePrice() {
		        this.price += 0.10;
			    }
			    
- Click price and note the changes object logged to the console.

		{"price":{"previousValue":0.45,"currentValue":0.55,"firstChange":false}}

#### ngOnChanges and complex arrays/objects.

- Add similar code to the buyStock method which reduces the stock property of the product object down to a minimum of zero.

		buyStock() {
			this.product.stock = Math.max( this.product.stock-1 , 0 );
		}
		
- Note this does reduce the displayed quantity, but does not trigger a call to **ngOnChanges**.
- Changes to the properties of complex arrays and objects do not trigger this event.
- Changes to values of primitive strings and numbers do.
- There are alternative solutions to make this work.
- This code makes a true independent copy of the object before changing it. This does trigger an ngOnChange event.

		    buyStock() {
	        this.product = Object.assign( {} , this.product );
	        this.product.stock = Math.max( this.product.stock-1 , 0 );
		    }
		    
#### ngDoCheck

- Alternatively, we can comment out the buyStock method and implement logic in the ngDoCheck method which will pick up changes to properties of objects/arrays.

			buyStock() {
		    // this.product = Object.assign( {} , this.product );
		    this.product.stock = Math.max( this.product.stock-1 , 0 );
			}
			
			ngDoCheck() {
        console.log("ngDoCheck", this.price, this.product );
	    }

- Note ngDoCheck may be invoked by many events/interactions in your application and may carry a big performance cost.
