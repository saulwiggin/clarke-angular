## Angular 5 Training Course
## Exercise E-di

- **Dependency injection (DI)** allows us to separate our project into **loosely coupled** parts.
- The **connections** between the parts are clearly defined.
- Each part is testable in **isolation**.
- Mock data can be **injected** into components.
- This example passes a **service** and an **object** between different parts of the project using DI. 

#### Setup

- Duplicate **c-compose** and rename the folder **e-di**.	
- Rebuild the project using NPM.

		npm install
		ng serve --open.

## Create a data service

- The fruit data is hard-coded in the main component as an array. We can move it into a **service**. 
- We will pass an instance of the service into the main component constructor using DI.
- Use the Angular-CLI to generate a new service.

		ng generate service service/data --dry-run
		ng generate service service/data
		
- Note: this command does not update **src/app/app.module.ts**. 	
- We need to manually add the service to the **NgModule providers** array. 

		import { DataService } from './service/data.service';	
		providers: [DataService]

- The Angular CLI creates a minimal service class with an empty constructor. The class is wrapped in an **Injectable** annotation.
		
		@Injectable()
		export class DataService {	
			constructor() {}	
		}

- Move the fruit array into the service, and create a getter method:

		    fruit = [ .... ];
		    
		    getFruit() {
		        return this.fruit;
		    }
		
- Import this service into the shop component:

		import { DataService } from "./service/data.service";
		
- Pass the service into the constructor.
		
		constructor( private ds:DataService ) { .. }
		
- Call the getFruit method of the service.

		this.fruit = ds.getFruit();
		
- Review the Injector Graph in the **Augury** Chrome extension.
		
- *Exercise : add a boolean parameter to getFruit which filters in only items that are in-stock.*

## Inject data objects directly

- You can pass simple JS data objects around using DI.
- Create a file **config/app.config.ts** that holds **project configuration** information.
- This object contains two properties.
- The **provide** property is the name that this object is referred to in DI.
- Its data is held as an object in the **useValue** property.

		// config/app.config.ts
		
		export const Config = {
		    provide:"config",
		    useValue : {
		        shop : "Southwold Organics",
		        addr : {
		            street : "14 Dolphin..",
		            postcode : "IP18 4HZ"
		        }
		    }    
		}

- Import it into **app.module.ts** and add it to the list of **providers**.

		 import { Config } from './config/app.config';
		 providers: [ DataService,Config ]
		  
- This object can be injected into the constructor.

			import { Inject } from '@angular/core';
			
			constructor( @Inject("config") private config , 
			private ds:DataService )

- Refactor the constructor to use this object.

        this.shop = config.shop;
        this.addr = config.addr;
        
- *Review the DI in the Augury Chrome extension.*

#### Use HTTP to read the data from a JSON file.

- Create a JSON file in the assets folder: **assets/data/fruit.json**
- Note the JSON data needs to be stringified.
- Add the Angular HTTP module to app.module.ts

		import {HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';		
		imports: [BrowserModule,HttpClientModule]
		
- Import the Angular HTTP client into the service.

		import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

- Inject the HTTP client into the service constructor.

		constructor( private http: HttpClient ) {}
		
- Change getFruit to use the HTTP get() method to read the JSON file.

			path : "assets/data/fruit.json";

		  getFruit() {
			  return this.http.get( this.path );
		  }
		  
- The main component already calls getFruit but this code will cause a runtime error.

		this.fruit = ds.getFruit();
		
- The HTTP get method returns an **Observable**, an object for handling an asynchronous stream of data.
- We need to subscribe to this stream in order to read the data.

		this.ds.getFruit().subscribe( fruit => this.fruit = fruit );
		
- *Observables will be covered in more detail later in the course.*
