## Angular 5 Training Course
## Exercise C-compose

- Angular components are **composable**. 
- Angular projects consist of a **hierarchy** of related components.
- This exercise **refactors**  example **b-shop** into separate components.
- Angular **Inputs** will pass data **in** to components.
- Angular **Outputs** will emit events **out** of components.

#### Setup

- Delete the node_modules folder in  **b-shop**.
- Duplicate and rename the folder as **c-compose**.

		npm install
		ng serve --open
		
- Check that the page still functions correctly.
		
#### Create a component for each item of fruit.

- The Angular CLI can **generate** new components.
- It updates **app/app.module.ts** to reflect those changes.
- Use the --dry-run option to find out what files would be created before creating them.

		ng generate component fruit --dry-run
		
- Run the command again without --dry-run to make the change.

		ng generate component fruit
		
- Iterate over the new fruit component in **app.component.html**

		<app-fruit *ngFor="let f of fruit"></app-fruit>

- This works but passes no information down to the fruit component.		

#### Inputs

- We pass data in to the fruit component using an **Input**.
- Import the input class.

		import { Input } from '@angular/core';
		
- Define the input decorator inside the class before the constructor.

		@Input() fruit;

- We can then pass a fruit object into each instance of this component. 
- [fruit] defines the Input and "f" refers to the temporary variable created by the ngFor iterator. 

		<app-fruit 
			*ngFor="let f of fruit"
			[fruit]="f">
			</app-fruit>
			
- Add debugging into the fruit component class to prove that the fruit object is being passed down.

		  ngOnInit() { console.log(this.fruit);}
		  
- The fruit object will be logged to the browser console.

		{type: "Pears", price: 1.85, instock: true, discount: 0.4}
		  
- Note, the Angular component **LifeCycle** means that the input does not come into existence until the OnInit method. 

#### Define the fruit template

- Edit **app/fruit/fruit.component.html** to define the fruit component template.
		
		<section class="fruit">
			<p>{{ fruit.type }}</p>
			<p>{{ fruit.price }}</p>
		</section>
		
- Adjust the price to take account of the **discount**.
- Format the price with a built-in **Angular Pipe**.

		<p>{{ fruit.price - fruit.discount | currency:"GBP":"£" }}</p>
		
- Conditionally style the section using an ngClass directive.

		<section class="fruit" 
		[ngClass]="{ 'outstock' : !fruit.instock }">
		
#### Emit Events using an Output Decorator

- When the user clicks on a fruit, we want the fruit component to emit an event.
- The main component template will listen for this event and runs its buyFruit method to push fruit into an array.
- Import and define an Output before the constructor.

			import {EventEmitter,Output} from '@angular/core';

      @Output() select = new EventEmitter();		

- Listen for this event in the fruit component template.

		<section class="fruit" (click)="select.emit()">
		
- Listen for the select event in the main template

		<app-fruit [fruit]="f" (select)="buyFruit(f)" >
		
- Add additional logic in the fruit component template to prevent out of stock items being bought.

		(click)="fruit.instock && select.emit()"
		
#### Create a basket in the main template.

- Edit the main template to iterates over the basket array.

		    <section class="flex">
		        <app-fruit
		            *ngFor="let f of basket"
		            [fruit]="f">
		        </app-fruit>
		    </section>
		    
- We do not want to call buyFruit when the user clicks on a basket item.
- We can listen for the same select event and then call removeItem().

			(select)="removeItem(f)"
			
#### Total

- We can add a total and empty button to the main template.

		<h2>{{ getTotal() | currency:"GBP":"£" }}</h2>
		
		<p *ngIf="basket.length" class="empty" (click)="empty()">Empty</p>
		
#### Custom Type

- We can define a Typescript custom type for each stock item.
- Create a new file **types/item.type.ts**
		
		export interface Item{
			type: string,
			price: number,
			instock:boolean,
			discount:number
		}

- Import the type into the main class.

		import { Item } from './types/item.type';
		fruit:Item[];
