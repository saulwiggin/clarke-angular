## Angular 5 Training Course
## Exercise I-vote

- This example reads and writes data to a **Node server** using GET and PUT calls from the Angular HTTPClient.

#### Review the Javascript-only version

- Open the **useful/vote** folder.
- Open the front-end **form/vote.html** in a browser.
- Choosing a village from the comboBox will add a vote 
- Click on the postcard image will delete all votes.
- Open the back-end **form/server** folder in the terminal.
- This contains a Node server.
- The Node server uses Express, Body-Parser, Debug and Node-Persist packages, which need to be installed:

		npm install
		
- Run the Node server

		node server.js
		
- The server is now running on **port 4000**.
- It defines/exposes several **routes**.
- The **/getvotes** route uses a GET to return the votes cast.
- The **/vote** route lets POST a new vote.
- The **/empty** route uses a GET to deletes all votes.
- The **/testdata** route creates test data.


#### Converting the front-end to Angular.

- Leave the Node server running in port 4000.
- Rebuild **useful/vote/angular**

		npm install
		ng serve --open

#### Add HTTP code to read votes cast

- We will use an **HTTP get** to read votes cast from the getVotes route on the server.
- Update the module file **app.module.ts**.

		import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
		
		imports:[ HttpClientModule ]
		
- Import the HTTPClient into the component.

		import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
		
- Inject the HTTPClient in to the constructor:

		 constructor( private fb:FormBuilder, private http: HttpClient ) {}
		 

- Define the server routes as constants.

		SERVER : string = "http://localhost:4000/village/";
		GET_VOTES : string = this.SERVER + "getVotes";

- Write a method that uses the HTTPClient get() to read votes from the server.
		
		getVotes() {
			this.http.get( this.GET_VOTES )
			.subscribe( data => console.log( data ))
		}
		    
- Call that method in the constructor

		this.getVotes();
		
- It should log an array of selected villages to the console.

		["Dumpling Green", .... ]

- Create a class property to display the votes cast.

		votes : any;
		
- Change getVotes to set this property.

		    getVotes() {
        this.http.get( this.GET_VOTES )
        .subscribe( data => this.votes = data )
    }
    
- Update the template to display that property.

		<section class="votes">
        <span class="village" *ngFor="let v of votes">{{ v }}</span>
    </section>

#### Create a function to vote.

- We need to send a stringified JSON object to the server containing the name of the village.

		"{"village": "Fiddlers Green"}"
		
- Update the selectVillage method.
		
		selectVillage( form ) {
			let vote = JSON.stringify( { village:form.village });
			console.log( vote );
		}
    
- Define a property for the vote route.

		VOTE : string = this.SERVER + "vote";
		
- We can call the **HTTP post** method, passing 2 arguments: the route and the vote data.

		this.http.post( this.VOTE , vote )
        .subscribe( data => this.votes = data);
        
- This only partially works, writing null to the server.

#### Set JSON headers for the post.

- We need to set HTTP headers to post this JSON data correctly.
- Import the relevant class.

		import { HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';
		
- In the selectVillage method set the headers.

		let jsonHeaders:HttpHeaders = new HttpHeaders()
        .set('Accept', 'application/json').set('Content-Type', 'application/json');

- Pass these headers as an additional parameter.

		this.http.post( this.VOTE , vote, { headers: jsonHeaders })
        .subscribe( data => this.votes = data)

- The complete selectVillage method:

		    selectVillage( form ) {
		        let vote = JSON.stringify( { village:form.village });
		
		        let jsonHeaders:HttpHeaders = new HttpHeaders()
		        .set('Accept', 'application/json').set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
		
		        this.http.post( this.VOTE , vote,{ headers: jsonHeaders } )
		        .subscribe( data => this.votes = data);
		    }
    		
#### Create a function to delete all votes.

- When the user clicks on the postcard, we will call an empty route on the server to delete all votes.
- Define the empty route.

		EMPTY : string = this.SERVER + "empty";
		
- Write a method to call this route with an http GET.

		empty() {
        this.http.get( this.EMPTY )
        .subscribe( data => this.votes = data)
    }
    
- Add a click event in the template

		<img (click)="empty()" src="assets/card.jpg" />
		
- Test this code by clicking on the postcard.
